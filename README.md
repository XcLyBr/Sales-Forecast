# Sales Predictions

## By Jose Antonio Villegas

We were tasked to review a sales data of a supermarket and grocery type store to analyze it and recommend business strategies. With the given data, I will focus on the analysis of the Item Outlet Sales based on the Outlet Size and Outlet Type. With this in mind, I sought answers to these questions:

  1) What outlet type generates more sales?
  2) Do outlet size relate to more sales/revenue?
  
  
 # The Four Major Objectives of a Business :
  
   - While every business might have specific goals according to their specific industry, team, product, or financial standing, business objectives often fall into four main categories:
     
     -  Economic
     -  Human
     -  Organic
     -  Social
   
   
   ## I will just focus on the economic objective.

Most businesses cite financial growth as an overarching goal or business objective, but depending on your businessâ€™s unique financial needs, your economic objective could be:

    - Survival: While the ultimate goal is to make enough money to pay for all overhead costs and also make a profit, 
      small businesses or new businesses might be focused on simply making enough revenue to cover the costs so that 
      they can stay in business.
    
    - Profit Earning: Beyond business survival, owners want to earn enough to have a salary and/or be able to grow the business.
    
    - Growth: Most business owners consider growth : how they will grow, what actions they will take when demand 
      outpaces production and how short- and long-term growth will affect their business.

What is shown is that there is 4 outlet types and the Supermarket Type 3 out performs the rest in sales/revenue.


2) Do outlet size relate to more sales/revenue?

    - Outlet has 3 sizes: Small
                          Medium
                          High
    
    - Medium sized outlets generate more sales compared to the others.
    
    - "Does size really matter?"
    

# In conclusion/recommendation:

  To be able to achive economic business objectives:
  
    - Continue/improve market/sales strategy on Supermarket Type 3s and focus on applying/adapting 
      these strategies on Grocery Type, Supermarket Type 1 and 2

    - Implement/incorporate sales targets and strategies on Small and High Outlet Size comparable to Mediem Outlet Size 
      market to meet or top sales/profitability.
