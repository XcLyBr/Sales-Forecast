# Sales Predictions

We were tasked to review a sales data of a supermarket and grocery type store to analyze it and recommend business strategies. With the given data, I will focus on the analysis of the Item Outlet Sales based on the Outlet Size and Outlet Type. With this in mind, I sought answers to these questions:

  1) What outlet type generates more sales?
  2) Do outlet size relate to more sales/revenue?
  
  
  The Four Major Objectives of a Business :
  
   - While every business might have specific goals according to their specific industry, team, product, or financial standing, business objectives often fall into four main categories:
     
     1 Economic
     2 Human
     3 Organice
     4 Social
   
   I will just focus on the economic objective.

Most businesses cite financial growth as an overarching goal or business objective, but depending on your businessâ€™s unique financial needs, your economic objective could be:

    Survival: While the ultimate goal is to make enough money to pay for all overhead costs and also make a profit, small businesses or new businesses might be focused on simply                 making enough revenue to cover the costs so that they can stay in business.
    
    Profit earning: Beyond business survival, owners want to earn enough to have a salary and/or be able to grow the business.
    
    Growth: Most business owners consider growth: how they will grow, what actions they will take when demand outpaces production and how short- and long-term growth will affect               their business.
